# Chinese-English Machine Translation using a Weighted-Transformer
This is a project using the UM Corpus dataset, and trained with a Weighted Transformer. It includes all the data processing and engineering as well.

Feel free to try running this notebook with different hyper-parameters and try to improve it. It also includes an implementation of a standard Transformer,
so you can try that out as well

# Details
This project is trained only on the Spoken section of the UM corpus dataset which contains around 200,000 examples, since training on the entire 2,000,000 examples
would take too long. I trained with a small Weighted Transformer model to train quickly, but you can try using a bigger model or more data (it is very easy to change the hyper-parameters) to increase the performance. The Spoken and Microblog sections seem to have to have the best data for general language translation.
